Which is where PPEs come in \u2013 to minimize worker\u2019s exposure to dangerous occupational hazards. PPEs are found in many work places, especially in the industrial sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Examples of some regularly used PPEs include:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Hard hats<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/hard-hat-white-1-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4664\" width=\"213\" height=\"213\" srcset=\"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/hard-hat-white-1-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/hard-hat-white-1-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/hard-hat-white-1-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/hard-hat-white-1-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/hard-hat-white-1-370x370.png 370w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/hard-hat-white-1.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 213px) 100vw, 213px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hard hats are designed to protect one of the most important part of the body \u2013 the head. They help reduce serious injury to the head from falling objects, provide protection when you bump your head, as all industrial activities take place both above ground level and on ground surface, putting workers heads in the firing line of many potential hazards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Headaches, migraines, lacerations, impaired vision, concussion can all result from head injuries, and are things we all wish to avoid. If we expand our list to include things like loss of mobility, permanent disfigurement, and death, the importance of protecting the head becomes more than obvious. And some hard hats even protect workers from arc flash, electrical shock, and burns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Safety goggles<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-goggle-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4665\" width=\"238\" height=\"238\" srcset=\"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-goggle-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-goggle-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-goggle-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-goggle-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-goggle-370x370.png 370w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-goggle.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019re working hard on site and everybody knows it, but are you keeping your eyes safe?

Thousands of eye injuries occur each year in industrial workplaces, don\u2019t be a part of the statistic. Remember, there\u2019s no such thing as a replacement eye.

Yes, it can! Regardless of what type of job site you\u2019re on there are always loud noises. And when you\u2019re exposed to loud noises over an extended period of time or even a short period of time when the noise is above 140 decibels, you\u2019re at increased risk of losing your ability to hear. It is therefore vital that everyone in the facility take appropriate steps to protect their hearing using the correct hearing protection for maximum protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Gloves<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-gloves-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4667\" width=\"262\" height=\"262\" srcset=\"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-gloves-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-gloves-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-gloves-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-gloves-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-gloves-370x370.png 370w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-gloves.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The hand is useful for quite a lot of things on a job site including welding, lifting, pouring, hitting, etc. It is almost impossible for workers not to use their hands while working on site. In fact, they use their hands constantly throughout the day that even a single hazard could cause a lot of pain and in some occasions lead to permanent damage of the hand. Regardless of the type of project site, it is imperative for professionals and managers to protect their hands by wearing proper safety gloves. The type of glove you have will depend on the type of work and degree of potential hazards you\u2019ll be working with. Always get the right glove for the job and remember to inspect your gloves before each use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>High visibility vests<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/high-visibility-vest-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4668\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/high-visibility-vest-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/high-visibility-vest-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/high-visibility-vest-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/high-visibility-vest-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/high-visibility-vest-370x370.png 370w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/high-visibility-vest.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Every day, workers put themselves in harm\u2019s way when working on busy and hazardous job sites. High visibility vests tend to come in bright colours, such as orange and green, and usually contain reflective safety strips for additional visibility. While these vests should be worn at all times when working on a site, it\u2019s especially important to wear them during dusk and at night to keep workers visible and safe on the job site. Remember, you have to be seen to be safe. Always wear high visibility clothing when working on potentially harmful job sites as this could actually save your life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Safety boots<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-boot-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4669\" width=\"282\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-boot-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-boot-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-boot-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-boot-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-boot-370x370.png 370w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-boot.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever felt the excruciating pain of a nail piercing through your shoe to your feet? A slippage that happens as a result of putting on regular shoes or no footwear at all? Or a hammer landing on your feet because they\u2019re not properly protected? If your answer is yes to any of these questions, then you already know why safety boots are of great importance. Safety shoes are specially modified shoes that protect the wearer from possible disasters that could lead to a foot injury. Considering the type of works that are done in construction, production, and other related industries, it doesn\u2019t take a soothsayer to tell what could go wrong without a safety boot. Workers should wear safety footwear for optimal foot protection at all times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fall protection<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-harness-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4670\" width=\"344\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-harness-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-harness-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-harness-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-harness-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-harness-370x370.png 370w, https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/safety-harness.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Falls are among the most common causes of serious work-related injuries and deaths in the industry.
