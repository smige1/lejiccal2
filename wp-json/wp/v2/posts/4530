These conditions can lead to a reduction in your instrument accuracy and efficiency which the consequences can be as grave as plant explosion, reduction in quality and overall productivity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calibration can be performed using either a reference standard or a known value. This will help prolong the lifespan of the process instrument and maintain its high level of performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How often should you calibrate your process instrument?<br>The frequency of calibration depends on the type of process instrument and the prevailing conditions of where the instrument is being used.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" title=\"Calibration\">Calibration<\/a> is required after any maintenance on the process instrument to ensure that the instrument is still conformed to the required calibration data.<br>\u2022 Recalibration should be carried out at least once a year. However, in some critical applications, the frequency of calibration will be greater such as recalibration once every six months.<br>\u2022 Recalibration should also be done when the process instrument was repaired after being faulty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, calibration is needed to make sure your process instrument is working correctly.
