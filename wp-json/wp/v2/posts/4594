These trainings will help educate their staff on what pressure vessels are, the content of each pressure vessel, the risk that they pose to the environment, and actions to take when a breach occurs. Engineers and technicians that will be managing these vessels should receive a formal training on how to properly use and manage a pressure vessel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Installation Of Protective Devices<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Every pressure vessel comes with a list of protective devices to help ensure and notify operators when there is an abnormal build-up of pressure. Example of such protective devices are Pressure relief valves, safety valves, pressure gauges, a pressure alarm indicating system, rupture disks etc. Some come with extra protection in place like insulation and coating of metal surfaces and so many others. All these are protective measures and requirements to help ensure a safe working environment and prevent accidents from occurring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Inspection<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In accordance with international standards and Nigeria\u2019s factory acts, it is mandatory for every industry to have their pressure vessels inspected and certified annually or bi-annually by certified inspectors. They ensure that the pressure vessels and its protective equipment are working as designed and an integrity test (Non-Destructive Test) of the steel used in fabrication of these pressure vessel should be carried out at least once every 5years to check for corrosion and ensure that the material thickness\/specification is still within acceptable range. &nbsp;All these helps to ensure and detect any possible failure or breakdown of the pressure vessels to avoid future catastrophe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Emobella Engineering Nigeria Limited, we offer <a href=\"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/boiler-pressure-vessel-inspection\/\">inspection and certification of pressure vessels<\/a> according to the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code worldwide and Nigerian factories act to help make sure that your pressure vessels are compliant and safe to operate. <a href=\"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/contact\">Contact us today to speak with our expert inspectors!<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ever wondered why there are so many legislations governing pressure vessel equipment?
