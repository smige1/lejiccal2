This system is designed to have features that will help in containing the fire to reduce casualties and property loss to the minimal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does a fire detection system work?<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>An effective fire detection system is equipped with an automated alarm system, detectors, sensors and sprinklers for fire exhaustion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a fire is detected by the detector it immediately sends a signal to the alarm system which alerts the public and then it sends a signal to the control panel which in turn automatically opens up the sprinklers to help contain the fire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the severity of the fire, the sprinklers may be able to extinguish the fire before the arrival of the firefighting department but in a more severe case, the detection system helps ensure that no life is lost and the relevant authorities are informed on time and exact location of the fire is automatically communicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Types of fire detectors<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 3 main types of fire detectors and knowing the difference could help you make the right choice for your office or building.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Heat detector<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Heat detectors are designed to send an alert when a rise in the room temperature is detected or if there\u2019s a significant amount of heat in the room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are mostly used in spaces that are not frequently occupied such as warehouses, storage closets, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Smoke detector<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Smoke detectors are activated when the presence of smoke is detected in the air.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smoke contains particulate matter and whenever there\u2019s a fire outbreak, the particulate matter rises into the air which is detected by the smoke detector which then triggers the alarm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smoke detectors are classified as either ionization or photoelectric smoke detectors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Flame detectors<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Lights such as ultraviolet lights, infrared lights, and visible lights are produced when a fire breaks out. Flame detectors detect any of this light and triggers a siren or buzzer in response.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of all three, flame detectors are very reliable and highly accurate, making them a popular choice among business owners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of installing a fire detection system<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Fire detection systems offer a great number of benefits, however, let\u2019s take a look at some of the most important ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Lives are protected<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Possibly the biggest reason for installing a fire detection system\u2026 An effective fire detection system will warn your employees of a possible fire outbreak, so they can take early actions to protect themselves by evacuating the building.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Early detection of smoke and fire<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With an effective fire detection system installed, you get alerted early on, in case of a fire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Damages are reduced<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>An advanced fire detection and alarm system will help reduce the risk of fire-related damages by alerting people in charge to extinguish the fire before it gets out of hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Fire safety is a fundamental mandate for commercial establishments and even residential properties, and it begins with fire detection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why investing in a good fire detection system is one of the best decisions you\u2019ll make for your business today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emobella Engineering Nigeria Limited can help you with any of your fire protection needs.
