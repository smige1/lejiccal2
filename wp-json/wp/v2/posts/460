The use proven, time-tested design of these meters provides accurate measurement across their respective flow ranges, even with severely perturbed flow velocities. Long-life and low maintenance are assured by the combination of high-quality ball bearings and efficient lubrication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" title=\"Itron Fluxi 2000\/TZ meter\">Itron Fluxi 2000\/TZ meter<\/a> is one of the turbine flow meters manufactured by Itron (Germany) which are specifically made to measure both natural and non-corrosive gases.\u00a0 The meter proven design and construction are based on high-precision parts and high-quality ball bearings which offers an optimal mix of high accuracy, large measuring range and resistance to high pressure and flow loads. No wonder they are the perfect solution to the measurement of medium to high gas flow, at low, medium or high pressure.<br><br>The Itron Fluxi 2000\/TZ meters have been optimized for use in all applications related to the transportation and distribution of gas. They are smart ready, meaning that they are all equipped for future needs.<br><br>Itron Fluxi 2000\/TZ components are:<br><br><em>Straightener<\/em>: The nose cone and fins straighten or condition the flowing gas; the smaller circular channel also increases the velocity of the gas, thus magnifying its kinetic energy.<br><br><em>Rotor<\/em>: A precision-machined 45\u00b0 bladed wheel; 60\u00b0 bladed wheel accommodates extended flow velocities.<br><br><em>Measuring unit<\/em>: High-quality, stress-free mounted ball bearings are encapsulated in chamber designed to limit dust ingress.<br><br><em>Magnetic coupling<\/em>: Pressure resistant and optionally high-temperature resistant.<br><br><em>Totalizer<\/em>: Freely rotating, weather tight for an easy reading even in severe environmental conditions.<br><br><em>High-frequency pulse generator<\/em>: An easily retrofittable sensor to pick-up rotor shaft and\/or wheel blade rotation.<br><br><em>Oil pump and reservoir<\/em>: Flushes fresh oil into the pressurized rotor ball bearing.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"itron-fluxi-2000-tz-meter-flow-meters\">Key Features includes:<br><br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compliant with all current European and International Standards.<br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excellent high-pressure accuracy.<br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accommodates even compact installations with severe flow perturbations.<br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduced pressure loss for low pressure network.<br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IP 67 protection of the totalizer for outdoors installations.<br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equipped as standard with the Cyble target.<br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AMR\/AMI compatible.<br><br><br>Contact us&nbsp; <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/CONTACTEMOBELLA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/CONTACTEMOBELLA<\/a> for supply, installation of all your gas metering need\/solution<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Itron Fluxi 2000\/TZ Meter are flow meters that are used to measure medium to high gas flow, at low, medium or high pressure<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3502,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0,"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"default","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-460","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-blog"],"aioseo_notices":[],"blog_post_layout_featured_media_urls":{"thumbnail":["https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/IMG_20181202_139-150x150.jpg",150,150,true],"full":["https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/IMG_20181202_139.jpg",1037,692,false]},"categories_names":{"1":{"name":"Blog","link":"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/category\/blog\/"}},"tags_names":[],"comments_number":"0","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/460"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=460"}],"version-history":[{"count":13,"href":"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/460\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4616,"href":"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/460\/revisions\/4616"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3502"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=460"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=460"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/lejiccal.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=460"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
